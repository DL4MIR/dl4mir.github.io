<center> <h1> Deep Learning for Music Information Retrieval (part 2) </h1> </center>

## 2021 CCRMA workshop (Aug 9th - Aug 13th)

A survey of cutting-edge research in MIR using Deep Learning. Instructors will explain and demonstrate concepts in models that are used in cutting-edge industry and academic research. Students will tackle a real problem of their choice using deep learning models. Instructors will serve as advisors to students in the course on-demand.

## Logistics

- Class meets: 
    - in the morning from 9:30AM to 11AM (PDT)
    - in the afternoon from 1:30PM to 3PM (PDT)

- Create a Google account. We will use Google Colaboratory
    - If you live in a place without access to google colab, try using a VPN, or create a github account and talk to the instructors for working alternatives
- How to set up your python environment in your personal computer:
    - [Install pyenv in your Mac](https://www.liquidweb.com/kb/how-to-install-pyenv-on-ubuntu-18-04/)
    - [Install pyenv in Ubuntu (linux)](https://www.liquidweb.com/kb/how-to-install-pyenv-on-ubuntu-18-04/)
    - [Install WSL if you use Windows](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/get-started-with-windows-subsystem-for-linux/2-enable-and-install) and follow the steps for Ubuntu (linux) above.
    - Packages to install with pip (make sure you install the latest version for python 3.6 or greater):
        - librosa
        - tensorflow
        - numpy
        - matplotlib
        - scipy
